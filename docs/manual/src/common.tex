\section{Usage}

\subsection{Introduction}

\par
UART pmod1553 is a fusesoc 1553 project that has all input/output data through the UART. The 1553 is for avaiation bus connections.
The UART is a simple interface for sending and receiving data, and does not emulate a bus endpoint or controller. Software that
reads and writes from the UART is responsible for that response.

\subsection{Interface}
\par
For xilinx fifo and uart the format is the same.
Data is received in the following ASCII string format:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ CMDS;D1;P1;I0;Hx5555\r
  $ DATA;D0;P1;I0;HxAAAA\r
\end{lstlisting}

\par
The fields are seperated by ; .

\begin{itemize}
\item The first is the sync type, Command/Status = CMDS, Data = DATA
\item The second is if there is a 4us delay, 1 = delay over 4us, 0 = no delay or less then 4us.
\item The third is parity, 1 = parity good, 0 = parity bad
\item The fourth is invert, 1 = core is inverting data, 0 = core is not inverting data
\item The fifth is the data in hex format, Hx???? where ? = 4 characters representing the data (16 bits in total).
\item The carrige return is the string terminator. This works well with serial consoles with local newline addition enabled.
\end{itemize}

\par
Data is sent in the following ASCII string format:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ CMDS;D1;P1;I0;Hx5555\r
  $ DATA;D0;P1;I0;HxAAAA\r
\end{lstlisting}

\par
The fields are seperated by ; .

\begin{itemize}
\item The first is the sync type, Command/Status = CMDS, Data = DATA
\item The second is to enable a 4us delay, 1 = delay of at least 4us, 0 = no delay or less then 4us.
\item The third is parity, 1 = parity odd (default), 0 = parity even
\item The fourth is invert, 1 = invert data, 0 = don't invert data
\item The fifth is the data in hex format, Hx???? where ? = 4 characters representing the data (16 bits in total).
\item The carrige return is the string terminator.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies}

\par
The following are the dependencies of the cores.

\begin{itemize}
  \item fusesoc 2.X
  \item iverilog (simulation)
  \item cocotb (simulation)
\end{itemize}

\input{src/fusesoc/depend_fusesoc_info.tex}

\section{Architecture}
\par
The project contains wrappers for the top level projects, and a common uart 1553 module for all.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{system\_wrapper} Contains the top level project module and contains uart\_1553\_core and any other logic needed.
  \item \textbf{uart\_1555\_core} Contains the PMOD1553, UART, and string generation interfaces.
\end{itemize}

\par

Please see \ref{Module Documentation} for more information per target.

\section{Building}

\par
The all UART pmod1553 is written in Verilog 2001. They should synthesize in any modern FPGA software. The core comes as a fusesoc packaged core and can be
included in any other core. Be sure to make sure you have meet the dependencies listed in the previous section.

\subsection{fusesoc}
\par
Fusesoc is a system for building FPGA software without relying on the internal project management of the tool. Avoiding vendor lock in to Vivado or Quartus.
These cores, when included in a project, can be easily integrated and targets created based upon the end developer needs. The core by itself is not a part of
a system and should be integrated into a fusesoc based system. Simulations are setup to use fusesoc and are a part of its targets.

\section{Simulation}
\par
There is no simulation at the moment. This is dues to the AD9361 and ARM subsystems. Maybe a future addition with Vexriscv?
